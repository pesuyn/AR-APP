## Introduction and goal of the project:
- Learn about ARCore.
- Learn about Augmented Faces.
- Create diversity of models and using Blender for measuring the size.
- Create a simple face-augmented application, using ARCore to build, apply models, display and demo on Android.

## Deployment environment / System Requirements

**Software:**
- Android Studio (2.8 or later)
- Blender: a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality and computer games.

**SDK tools for ARCore:**
- Google APIs Level 28 or later

**Libraries:**
- Sceneform (1.15.0): Allows you import and view 3D models (in such formats as .obj, .fbx or .glTF) and then render realistic 3D scenes for ARCore apps or VR apps, without having to learn OpenGL. Sceneform includes a high-level Scene Graph API, a Physically Based Renderer (PBR) provided by Filament and Android Studio plugin for building 3D assets. ARCore is not able to import and render 3D models. ARCore is made for tracking and scene understanding stages.

**Tools:**
- Phone or Tablets are running Android with front-facing camera.

## Prerequisites
- You have installed all the Deployment environment/System Requirements.
- You have a basic understanding of Java.

## Terms & Conditions
- By downloading the ARCore SDK for Android, you agree that the Google APIs Terms of Service governs your use there of.

## User privacy requirements
- You must disclose the use of Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) and how it collects and processes data, prominently in your application, easily accessible to users. You can do this by adding the following text on your main menu or notice screen: "This application runs on Google Play Services for AR (ARCore), which is provided by Google LLC and governed by the Google Privacy Policy".

## Status of the Project
**Accomplishment**
- Detection of real faces using ARCore .
- Created diversity of models for applying models to real faces. 
- Apply models to real faces.
- Selected list of models

## Unsolved Problems
- ARCore session is not restarting
- Unable to take a photo/screenshot 


## Get started
- To build the project, download or clone and open it in Android Studio. All dependencies should automatically be fetched by Android Studio.
- You can check if your device is supported on [this list](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices).
- To run the project, connect your phone/tablets and run app .
- While running the app you can switch the models by choosing another models in the models list.
- Wait for the models to apply on your faces, then take a photo by press on the camera button.
